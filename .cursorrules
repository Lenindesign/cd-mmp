## 🚨 DEPLOYMENT RULES (CRITICAL)

**NEVER run any deployment commands without EXPLICITLY asking the user first and waiting for confirmation.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- `npm run deploy-storybook`
- `npx gh-pages`
- `git push`
- `npm run deploy`
- `netlify deploy`
- Any CI/CD pipeline triggers

**Required behavior:**
1. When a task is complete and deployment might be needed, ASK: "Would you like me to deploy these changes?"
2. WAIT for the user to explicitly say "yes" or give approval
3. Only THEN run the deployment command

**Why:** The user wants full control over when changes go live.
